# DSA Assignment

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of BFS, hashing, and heap sort to solve a real-world problem in an airline management system. It includes the implementation of these algorithms and their integration to find, store, and sort flight routes.

## Files

- `Graph.java`: Contains the `Graph` class and BFS implementation.
- `HashTable.java`: Contains the `HashTable` class for airport lookup.
- `Heapify.java`: Contains the heap sort implementation for route sorting.
- `Main.java`: Main script to run the program.

## Dependencies

- Java JDK 8 or later

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Save all the code files (`Graph.java`, `HashTable.java`, `Heapify.java`, `Main.java`) in the same directory.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4. Compile the Java files using the command:
   ```sh
   javac vishw/*.java
   ```
